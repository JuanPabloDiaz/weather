# Show the Local Weather 🌤️

This project is a responsive web application that asks the user for permission to access their geolocation, then makes a call to a weather API and fetches the weather data for the user's location. The application then displays the weather data in a user-friendly format.

## Description 💡

This project was built as part of the **[freeCodeCamp’s legacy Front End Development Certification]()**. The goal was to build a Local Weather with React.
